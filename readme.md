Broodwar Chat Enhancements
==========================

This is an old computer game hack that I wrote back in like 2004. I wrote this over the course of a week or two. This was a dll to be injected into a running Broodwar process. The aim of this hack was to enhance the functionality of Broodwar's own Battle.net interface. It added nifty features like a anti-spam flood queue system, and other things.
